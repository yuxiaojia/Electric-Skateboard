# Electric-Skateboard
This ongoing project consists of three modules: a remote-control module that uses the PSoC6-BLE microcontroller and self-designed PCB to control the speed of the skateboard, a skateboard module that contains another PSoC6-BLE microcontroller receiving the commands from remote controller via BLE, and a phone application that displays the current speed of the skateboard.
